## ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing

If you want to contribute with the website, please feel free! 

We recommend joining [our Discord](https://discord.gg/sqpu4R552r) and heading over to **#leaderboard-dev** with your contribution idea before starting any work to make sure there's no conflifts with another contributors work.

We have our website all mocked-up by our design team. If you need to add new sections added or make changes to the design, please check before with the design team on our Discord.
